# MPDL_Poject_1
Project repo for "Masterpraktikum Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing" at the Ruhr University Bochum in the summer term 2023.

## Objective of the project
The objective of the first project of the seminar was to train a binary image classifier capable of distinguishing between real and fake images. Real images are any images taken with a camera, while fake images are those generated by current text-to-image models such as stable-diffusion, midjourney, or Dall-E.

## Dataset
We trained our model on a custom dataset. The documentation of its composition can be found on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hanneseh/MPDL_Project_1_custom_data)
